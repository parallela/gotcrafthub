# Command types:
#   "command" - Run as player (e.g., "servers" or "server")
#   "console:command" - Run as console (e.g., "console:give %player_name% diamond 1")

# Examples:
#   command: "servers"           # Opens server selector if you have that command
#   command: "shop"              # Opens shop if you have that command
